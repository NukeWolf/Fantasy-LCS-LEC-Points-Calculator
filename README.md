# Fantasy-LCS-LEC-Points-Calculator
This is an alternative after Riot Games stopped supporting fantasy LCS. This repos emulates a similar match scoring system to RIOT Games. It takes data from Riot's Match History API, process all of the kills,deaths,cs, etc. into points, and then puts in all into a google sheet.

It runs off of taking match history data from https://lol.gamepedia.com/ processing the data and using gspread module to input all of the data into google sheets
